 # MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment

This assignment covers MongoDB fundamentals including setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.

## Assignment Overview

You will:  
1. Set up a MongoDB database  
2. Perform basic CRUD operations  
3. Write advanced queries with filtering, projection, and sorting  
4. Create aggregation pipelines for data analysis  
5. Implement indexing for performance optimization  

## How to Work With the Data

All queries to interact with and manipulate the database are contained within the `queries.js` file. This is the main file where you will find and run queries for:

- Finding, inserting, updating, and deleting documents  
- Performing filtering, sorting, and projection  
- Running aggregation pipelines  
- Creating indexes for optimization  

### Running `queries.js`

1. Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) installed.  
2. Verify that the MongoDB connection string inside `queries.js` points to your database.  
3. Run the queries by executing the script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   node queries.js
